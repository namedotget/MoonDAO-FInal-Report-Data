There are important things to pay attention to, like configuring metamask settings to avoid high gas fees, and only using wallets that are non-custodial. The fundamental learning from laying the guild's foundation is that they are poor conduits for actual work. Guilds should be for discussing and supporting early-stage ideation, not monitoring ongoing progress. Going forward we've determined that guilds do not need bounties. Dework is more useful as a transparent record than for ongoing task management. Dework seems more useful for contests, but could have higher potential for certain types of tasks. It may have more potential with greater integration into discord. We should also experiment with “long shot” bounties (for example, get us an AMA with Neil Degrass-Tyson).\n\n5) **Maintenance**: None required.\n==================================\n\n### **Objective 2:** Define the road map for community guild in short term and long term (Mitchie, luffy)\n\n#### **Key Result**: created a road map for community guild in particular and a path towards for guilds operation in general.

While still in ideation, the proposal’s impact has resulted in a town hall AMA with Coordinape founder Zakku, and greater partnership potential between Coordinape and MoonDAO.\n\n      3. **Complexity:** The core principle of this program has been that standard indexing of contributions is necessary for fair and cohesive reward distribution and active engagement. Identifying means of indexing contributions with limited time overhead cost and operational resistance was the priority and a multifaceted challenge. The plan identified is elegantly simple, but was the result of innovation in resolving many complex factors.2) **Key Result**: Implement and test prototype UIs for indexing and visualizing contributions\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**:\\\n      Experimental results:[Community Recognition Program V1 - UI Samples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWHQAVDjyaNKU5LCp7pQeefrJxGhTCqybYKhy9VQ3CU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Impact:__** Early experiments in designing a UI (linked above) highlighted the complexity of the challenge and potential for time overhead costs and operational resistance. \n\n   3. **Complexity:** In approaching this task, a lot of effort was put into analysis and research of MoonDAO’s working operations and structure. While the approach of designing a UI ultimately failed, challenges that it uncovered informed pivotal innovations.3) **Key Result:** Direct a pilot program to test functionality and collect feedback\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**: None \n\n   2. **Impact:__** None\n\n   3. **Complexity:** None\n\n4) **Key Result:** Plan and document an awareness campaign to promote the program\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution:** None\n\n   2. **Impact:** None\n\n   3. **Complexity:** None2) **Objective:** 2. ****Automate Time-Consuming Operations1) **Key Result**: Target bottlenecks, pain points, and manual operations\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**: [Community Guild Automations & Operations Impact Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1yxcnyF0WpXBEDbTAut6Ww0PJfP0WPE4VOarzDrAVGMY/edit)\n\n   2. **Impact:__** This document was made to visualize the distribution of impact of the initial projects and opportunities identified in community guild meetings. The domains are those outlined in objective 2.A.\n\n   3. **Complexity:** Especially within the first month of the charter, intense effort was directed towards identification of key projects that holistically support the automation of operations. Care was taken to align the efforts of the projects identified with the objectives of the other guilds.2) **Key Result**: Development of overhead-minimal operational standards and processes \n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**:  [Stewardship Q2-2023](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/13vqVrIeer_yTslq7Mzi8D3eGKoanGswVCMNCn0rimqw/edit)\n\n   2. **Impact:__** While not necessarily an example of a time-consuming operation, this proposal does demonstrate development of operational standards that are inline with the overall objectives of the community guild. It has also resolved concern for overspending on guilds by eliminating steward MVPs.\n\n   3. **Complexity:** This project involved a lot of coordination, collecting feedback, reconciling opinions, researching, and planning. Identifying and characterizing the problem required first-hand experience and a proactive lead. 3) **Key Result**: Oversight of development and solutions implementation\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**: None\n\n   2. **Impact:__** None\n\n   3. **Complexity:** None3) **Objective:** 2.A Implementation of community engagement and operational dashboard\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Research and define key metrics for measuring community engagement and operations\n\n      1. **Specific Contribution**: [Guild Performance Dashboard V1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o9GP6LePuv2XiJ6Z8JAwgDCgcAR53KqcswuIIVqFjzw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n      2. **Impact:__** This strategy has secured an informed framework for analyzing MoonDAO’s onboarding performance metrics. The result will facilitate a data-driven approach to community stewardship and inform our organizational infrastructure developments.\n\n      3. **Complexity:** This plan involved deep analysis of both MoonDAO’s onboarding hurdles and its members.

It’s being developed in anticipation of discord bots that will monitor, transcribe, and index interactions in order to auto generate and post synthetic media.2) **Key Result**: Define short-term (3 month) and long-term roadmap for AI (GPT) integration\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**: [MoonDAO AI roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4gLOJm5Z3_dEPnRENq_4ryLum95qPHkTLwDwZ6AuBg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Impact:** __This contribution has not directly [MoonDAO AI roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4gLOJm5Z3_dEPnRENq_4ryLum95qPHkTLwDwZ6AuBg/edit?usp=sharing) impacted our results, but could be useful in measuring the rate of progress as we speed through the initial stages of revolutionary innovations. \n\n   3. **Complexity:** The escalating change of impact in AI on market conditions over the last three months exceeded the ability to plan ahead with specific measures, however Mitchie has been a vocal advocate for concern of this topic at several town hall and guild meetings. The roadmap presented is a general overview of trends identified as a result of continuous R\\&D. 3. **Key Result**: Oversee development and primary implementation\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**: [Legal Considerations](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1KYdTHY4Zw3FWk3j78Qrpro5s0X_1Ci5CRpN3wmDsPKE/edit)\n\n   2. **Impact:__** While the technical complexity of development has been handled mostly by Colin, Mitchie’s impact has been on guiding the implementation. Complexities were dropped in favor of a less-secure good faith agreement, but this highlighted the need for a partnership branch of governance which is close to being underway. This is also an example for why a hypothetical legal guild may become necessary.\n\n   3. **Complexity:** Reconciling how development of bots should be funded with legal considerations presented significant hurdles that have encumbered innovation.**Colin (@Name.get)*** **Bounty:** Task 4.3.
