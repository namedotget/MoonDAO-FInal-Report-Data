  "body": "# **Token Listing Project Final Report****Summary**\n\n# The token listing team successfully listed MOONEY on two top-twenty exchanges, MEXC and GateIO. In addition we also deployed market making services on the exchanges where MOONEY was listed. [Snapshot Link](https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0xa9fc5b9122ecad63d17d460bbeb69a2f8b10c8aeee57627a65b821f53e8fb589)\n\n# **Results**\n\n# 1. **Objective**: _Improve the exposure and accessibility of MOONEY_\n\n   1. **Key Result**: _Get MOONEY listed on 4 centralized exchanges_\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: @Barney, @Larrotiz_._\n\n      2. **Results**: _MOONEY was listed on 2 centralized exchanges,_ [_GateIO_](https://www.gate.io/trade/MOONEY_USDT) _and_ [_MEXC_](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/MOONEY_USDT?_from=search_spot_trade)\n\n      3. **Learnings:** _The team learned that it is easier to negotiate listings when your token is more popular and has higher trading volume. In the future if we decide to list on more exchanges it would be better to wait until MOONEY has a surge in trading volume._\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: _The market making funds will still need to continue to be managed. Contact with the exchanges will need to be maintained as well in the event any issues arise. @Barney and @Larrotiz will continue to do this voluntarily._\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score: _0.7_**\n\n2. **Objective:** _Create and adopt a token logo for MOONEY._\n\n   1. **Key Result**: _A recognizable token logo is created_\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: @Barney, @ Larrotiz\n\n      2. **Results**: Never completed. We decided not to go forward with this objective due to possible confusion with the changing of the logo. We still were able to make a work around with the centralized exchanges even though the main logo is not circular.\n\n      3. **Learnings:** _A DAO wide vote would make more sense if we were to adopt new branding for MOONEY._\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: N/A\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-Reported Score: 0**\n\n# **Team Member Contributions**\n\n### **@Barney**\n\n# **Objective**: Conduct the reach out and communicate with centralized exchanges_._1) **Key Result**: _Reach out to 60 exchanges_\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**: _Ended up only communicating with around 10 exchanges._\n\n   2. **Impact:__** _It was important to get a gauge of the market for listing MOONEY by reaching out to several top exchanges._\n\n   3. **Complexity:** _It was sometimes difficult to get a hold of listing teams on some centralized exchanges. Also many centralized exchanges operate on Asian timezones._\n\n2) **Key Result**: _Get MOONEY listed on 3 centralized exchanges_\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution:** _MOONEY was listed on 2 centralized exchanges._\n\n   2. **Impact:** _It directly benefited the main goal of the project_\n\n   3. **Complexity:** _It was difficult to negotiate deals with exchanges to get a fair deal for MoonDAO. Also managing all the operations leading up to the listing event was a big time burden._\n\n### **@Larrotiz**\n\n# **Objective**: Conduct the reach out and communicate with centralized exchanges_._3) **Key Result**: _Reach out to 60 exchanges_\n\n   1. **Specific Contribution**: _Ended up only communicating with around 10 exchanges._\n\n   2. **Impact:__** _It was important to get a gauge of the market for listing MOONEY by reaching out to several top exchanges._\n\n   3. **Complexity:** _It was sometimes difficult to get a hold of listing teams on some centralized exchanges.

I didn’t reach out but I was a point of contact and did AMAs with them, video interviews like this_ \n\n   2. **Impact:__** _Promotion for the token listings is an important part of this_\n\n   3. **Complexity:** _It was sometimes difficult to get a hold of listing teams on some centralized exchanges.
