The last video was about the MoonDAO governance and how to contribute by MoonDAO.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: its took a lot of time to review the video and talk to video makers to modify the videos. \n\n      3. **Maintenance**: n/a\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 0.8\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**: Reviewed the applications in the Dework, reviewed the video content, talked to video markers to modify the videos and launched the payment for video markers.\\\n         **Stellie**:****\n\n   2. **Key Result**: Gain sufficient content to begin wider media campaigns\n\n      1. **Results**: One video (interview with contributors) was repurposed and published natively to Twitter. \n\n      2. **Learnings**: \n\n      3. **Maintenance**:\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: \n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**:\\\n         **Stellie**:****\n\n   3. **Key Result**: Promote broader engagement with and awareness of MoonDAO\n\n      1. **Results**: We had +196 subscribers to MoonDAO’s channel on YouTube during the length of this project, bringing the total to 644, representing a 44% increase in subscribers. There were 2,269 views amounting to 84 hours of content consumed. \n\n      2. **Learnings**: \n\n      3. **Maintenance**: n/a\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 0.5\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**:\\\n         **Stellie**: ****![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfWqKunNkOWzwfDxUptetuSSIIUXN2UjfvPCuqOoEsQk-ZEbxTf0UlvUbagrJbJubu8Y411-hmsLqWHJ0Ks8OL-3Y5bflAsFHkLjIFw9EH5RjuOthbOMx3-1UrUst9lSuGJGK6TujGxPLVNsCxutQBTYKEO?key=bbExh8ucnteukM3MhehaTQ)********3) **Objective:** Establish a panel to review video ideas and provide support in production\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Promote higher quality video projects\n\n      1. **Results**: no\n\n      2. **Learnings**: \n\n      3. **Maintenance**: n/a\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: \n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**:\\\n         **Stellie**:****\n\n   2. **Key Result**: An internal place to concentrate resources for video production\n\n      1. **Results**: no\n\n      2. **Learnings**: \n\n      3. **Maintenance**:\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: \n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**:\\\n         **Stellie**:****\n\n   3. **Key Result**: Promote early and comprehensive awareness of video projects amongst stakeholders\n\n      1. **Results**: no\n\n      2. **Learnings**: \n\n      3. **Maintenance**:\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: \n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**:\\\n         **Stellie**:****\n\n4) **Objective:** Generate a publishing schedule and ancillary media\n\n   1. **Key Result**: A coordinated video campaign to maximize the impact of each video\n\n      1. **Results**: There was a major delay in going live with this due to a project member stepping down. We did manage to queue up 4 videos for semi-regular publishing.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: It would be best to have a backlog of other videos in the queue to go live for something like this, because we held off for a long time to get a few videos on hand to publish, and then didn’t really have anything else after the fact, despite another two video or YouTube-based projects in the pipeline (MoonDAO in Motion and MoonDAO Podcast).\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: no\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: \n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ryan:** Uploaded the content to YouTube.****\n\n   2. **Key Result**: Theming of content\n\n      1. **Results**: no\n\n      2. **Learnings**: \n\n      3. **Maintenance**:\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: \n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**:\\\n         **Stellie**:****\n\n   3. **Key Result**: 16+ pieces of ancillary media to be used across multiple platforms\n\n      1. **Results**: no\n\n      2. **Learnings**: \n\n      3. **Maintenance**:\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: \n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ballack**:\\\n         **Stellie**:****\n\n   4. **Key Result**: Generate thumbnails and launch announcements for video publications\n\n      1. **Results**: Made custom thumbnails in Canva for the videos uploaded in this project\\\n         ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcDyzFt9vx_jSj3R8UBmBQX5CiBreb-CekG3KS3iNvIVhPaVSPzYAEKfl6sHI9kfI0N-nAAJuPMTl6Fc5kxLXouDex_alH07Lmx3RAKVwRAv_insbRFsy9vqSDOtVTPWDMfszPoSAcZziDk8cubE4qADSnL?key=bbExh8ucnteukM3MhehaTQ) \n\n      2. **Learnings**: Canva has a variety of great templates that we can use specifically for this, access is controlled via LastPass sharing.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: No maintenance.\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1.0\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Ryan:** Made thumbnails in Canva, uploaded them, also wrote the video titles and descriptions, including CTA at end.
