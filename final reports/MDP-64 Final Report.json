I still consider this still unfinished.\n\n   3. **Score: 0.2**\n\n   4. **Learnings:** We need a better model of how to create this marketplace. Maybe we can leverage the new NFT marketplace to create standard contracts in the form of NFTs. We need better external communications and building a reputation of having quality engineers. Volume for a two way marketplace. Would be good to build a list of capabilities and backgrounds, and create a directory of engineers at MoonDAO that are available for work.\n\n   5. **Maintenance: None**\n\n6) Task 4.2: Manage the logistical, operations, and legal around matching that task with guild members and the right revenue split between the member and the company. **(Pablo Lead)**\n\n   1. **Member(s)**: **(Pablo Lead)**\n\n   2. **Results**: See above.

Objective 5:** Figure out ways to converge Decentralized Science and Open Hardware to benefit the overall development of new and existing technology within MoonDAO. (Manuel Lead)1. **Key Result**: Task 5.1 Identify, build and implement Decentralized Science tools for scientists to contribute their research to MoonDAO.\n\n   1. **Results**: [Space Technology Papers Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tSVsb64LpinBsq7W_pvyCeU9nmQO7x0JbbJOQakA9Ac/edit?usp=sharing) [Challenges in Science - DeSci](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LSDjLuKZajuiStPK_ygJ9z7-NzQlRRoxVDwcQjyGDVg/edit?usp=sharing) [DeSpace ecosystem DeSci in Space.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UJIDjGMgtWL9cuQT3HhO6AiswUiOZ_5u/view?usp=sharing) [DeSpace: DeSci in Space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vAJfI8GptpxeccmmAhzQcFDclORHpOcK48QjfcSIl6U/edit?usp=sharing) [Decentralized Science Twitter Landscape](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12EW9ecS3sgxKM_kijCYFXrQEODKX1MKO9ex8YczjSa0/edit?usp=sharing) [DeSci Tools Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12JsoAJvMRc0G1MNd0fsrTUoa1tpag_9k9BGN6IExP70/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Learnings: This report is for current and future MoonDAO members to orient in the Academic world, in the Intellectual Property markets and Prototyping facilities.** \n\n      1. The reason why I wanted to identify opportunities for either building or implementing Decentralized Science tools is that I strongly believe we can tap into undiscovered opportunities in DeSci and Regenerative Finance (ReFi). \n\n      2. If we can provide our members and other scientific communities with the tools to securely store and distribute scientific data we enable people to start working actively on hardware prototyping and data simulations for the best possible impact. [DeSci.World](http://desci.world) already created a comprehensive overview of DeSci projects. \n\n      3. With involvement in the upcoming DeSci survey, I will build the data stream for advanced data analytics. With this activity, our community stays up-to-date about the latest changes and opportunities for implementation in DeSci. \n\n      4. A positive sign that plays into this is the co-creation of our own NFT marketplace. We can create sub-systems that enable community members to register their own space papers paving the way for Space Scientists to get into DeSci through MoonDAO. This is my definition of Decentralized Space Exploration (DeSpace). \n\n      5. Further activities with Gitcoin to participate in the upcoming DeSci Grants round and the opportunity to build our own platform for distributing Grants for DeSpace ecosystem-building through the Gitcoin Grants Stack enable the positioning of MoonDAO as a leader in Decentralized Space Science paving the way for strategic partnerships. \n\n      6. Another opportunity related to DeSci and DeSpace is the creation of technological-specific Research Guilds or Sub-DAOs based on the complexity and fragmentation of space-related science and engineering. The potential to onboard massive scientific datasets, academic communities, and student groups is linked to the concept of B2B DAO in which we can partner up with major Research institutes and R\\&D departments.\n\n      7. For sure we can build these communities on our own and be more independent as a DAO but the most leverage is provided by partnering up with established stakeholders in Space Science. For this, we’ll need a straightforward B2B sales framework to win them in the long-run.\n\n      8. First I had a look at the official NASAs Commercial Space Technology Roadmap (<https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/commercial_space_technology_roadmap.pdf>). \n\n      9. Based on the provided sectors and sub-sectors I collected trending papers from Google Scholar to provide our members with a comprehensive database of scientific papers ideally in PDF format. \n\n      10. Then I mapped out the general challenges and tasks we need to be aware of as a DAO when building tools on our own or partnering up with other players in DeSci to solve these challenges for our community members in science. \n\n      11. With a comprehensive presentation, I represented MoonDAO at ETHDenver talking about Decentralized Space Exploration and how to implement DeSci tools for solving these challenges. \n\n      12. Additionally, involvement in the upcoming DeSci Survey will provide us with real-world customer feedback to make better decisions about the prioritization of objectives while Gitcoins DeSci Telegram channel supports this objective to know about community-driven intitiatives. \n\n      13. I believe the low-hanging fruit is to engage the DeSci ecosystem as well while building partnerships with major sponsors and Grants protocols in web3 to enable Space Scientists with crypto crowdfunding opportunities to fund their research in the short term.\n\n      14. For this I created a _DeSci Industry Overview based on Twitter activities and a DeSci Tools Overview using information from DeSci World on Github (_[_https://github.com/DeSciWorldDAO/awesome-desci_](https://github.com/DeSciWorldDAO/awesome-desci**)_)._\n\n      15. Next steps are to reach out to the DeSci ecosystem with specific partnerships in mind while applying for Web3 and traditional Space Grants (like ESA Lunar Tender) with MoonDAO projects and building our own Grants Support Network with Web3 Foundations for the DeSpace ecosystem.\n\n2. **Key Result**: Task 5.2 More qualified space scientists should be drawn to MoonDAO\n\n   1. **Results:** [University\\_USA\\_College\\_Towns](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14n5Dq9PH8y6bijEM1w7g5ztd3SlijUAxWQcGA0Yb0-Q/edit?usp=sharing) [SU Exponential Innovation Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fU8zuG1EwzyZ0S4MisU-2DMZvgRVquPAdzep5ux5zts/edit?usp=sharing) [YC Startup Advice](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qg9Smz1RNPweew23GNeo89pkzZBmY_iAiiiErNVzu5w/edit?usp=sharing) [100 Tasks Checklist by Bell Ventures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lmd-AXkwvTWLqj9ExSfrxus4aJaPp5gArBcujmSgDzY/edit?usp=sharing) [DAO Building by BioDAO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IbnTbVJLrm7wyCXfg0wzUgKES3oDcnBl929QuUd73UQ/edit?usp=sharing) [MoonDAO Space Science & Sustainability Guild Proposal WIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HluxQPkTHV7egQYpeDaoIXjXCLlEEQHbI8lceb7Nm04/edit?usp=sharing) [Linkedin Campaign Space Scientists](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BFbqLX1-BNNKhPZAjrp4J4YGzs4EAuHccPcMYfxxGqU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Learnings:****-Connecting to key decision-makers:**1. I had chats with the Military (Bundeswehr) University in Germany who work on a Space Accelerator program while exploring web3 applications. Contact got lost because of internal restructuring.\n\n2. Will follow up in the next Quarter to work on this long-term. _They have connections to other major universities in Germany like Technical University Munich (TUM). Also, a student working group of RWTH university in Aachen is in touch with me and I want to explore more ways for Open Innovation and Hackathons there._\n\n3. _Through Davos attendance, I was in touch with Open Access experts from MIT and Harvard, NASA, and CERN. Only with CERN there were serious chats about Technology and Knowledge Transfer._\n\n4. Additionally, I started a Linkedin Connection Campaign with 277 NASA Scientists, did Follow-Ups and funneled the SEG pipeline to Rod for further SEG Onboarding.\n\n5. I added a list of universities in the US for further partnership activities. We can build these lists individually for members looking for outreach activities in their individual regions.**-Strategizing _Open Entrepreneurship/ Innovation Frameworks:_** 1) So the goal here is really to create an Innovation Ecosystem where we use the principles of Open Science, Open Innovation, and Hardware Development for the initial value creation out of our DAO and beyond.\n\n2) Additionally, I will lay out the methodologies and tools to do that for hyperlocal groups independently enabling the MoonDAO community to build their own innovation powerhouse.\n\n3) For this, it is crucial to first ensure the Knowledge Transfer from Universities and R\\&D departments to MoonDAO.\n\n4) Second, it is necessary to capture the value again with either own incubation programs, joint university incubators, or external incubation/ acceleration.\n\n5) From MoonDAOs perspective, it might be also useful to use Gitcoins Grants Stack as a Spin-Off launchpad for the DeSpace industry to get initial funding for R\\&D and Technology Transfer Initiatives.\n\n6) Additionally, we’ll need basic innovation management frameworks (<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A5Pk1G07hFV0rHbrMQZAjag-AUREYz43?usp=sharing>) to ensure the competitiveness of our future projects and to enable a seamless Go-To-Market strategy and execution afterwards.\n\n7) We can also use this for MoonDAO Corporate Innovation Consulting gigs to add additional revenue streams (<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ppQ-a8RO5dnN6HueynHcS2Ey0A7CzMZI/view?usp=sharing>)\n\n8)  Especially if we cooperate with other corporations and startups it is useful to provide a straight-forward Venture Building and DAO Building approach if needed with specific milestones in place to measure our future projects success in later stages and to hold the initial team accountable (<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dQdYei_F4Ln4PBq1aazTiiwQoDG9m1ya/view?usp=sharing>).\n\n9) **_I’m advocating for a University Advocacy/Fellowship Program for MoonDAO to engage local student communities._**\n\n10) The best opportunities to get this forward are to stay connected with RWTH, TUM, and BWUNI in Germany and other universities around the globe to attract University Student Group leaders to MoonDAO.\n\n11) Besides that, I reached out to NASA Technology Transfer without the success of getting them into a meeting.\n\n12) We can use CERNs Open Science frameworks and explore Open Hardware prototyping opportunities with the universities.3. **Key Result**: Task 5.3 More futurists should be inspired to join MoonDAO\n\n   1. **Results**: [Future Studies & Foresight Institutions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10FGWdD9HOkYqxsTHUDEgOy3lKk1GzQqzepsmOEl4UMw/edit?usp=sharing) [Science Fiction Prototyping Framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_AMZXO_X8nVkDLTgUuMEsILdErCVjuEVfTxKOHOKm4/edit?usp=sharing) [Outline of Future Studies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O1OFKk4VopFbHxTGgJJ2xa-WUDlBZRSnDsTslnOTYRk/edit?usp=sharing) [Outline of Science & Technology Studies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pDS6bu4ude5g3h5USbIbiteqkw7Z3OB3seU9jlaW2aE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Learnings:**\n\n      1. I believe that Future Thinking and Scenario Thinking Workshops for our community members can be valuable when it comes to modeling alternative realities through technological convergence in Space.\n\n      2. These activities can lead the way for ideation and reality checks for upcoming MoonDAO projects and potential future impact.\n\n      3. A potential community engagement activity can be Science Fiction Prototyping where we collectively design real-world concepts out of Sci-Fi future predictions (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_prototyping>).\n\n      4. While I did customer interviews with futurists to understand their needs for joining MoonDAO it was mainly related to creating revenue. Most futurists with a business want to win clients. These people are normally occupied either in a private corporation with less time or in entrepreneurial activities with time available if there are incentives. I believe our current Bounty system might be of value to attract more Futurists.\n\n      5. Also for future partnerships, it might be useful to assess the innovation potential of each company so that we can connect futurists from our community to our own MoonDAO Referral Network with a focus on large corporations and public partners.\n\n      6. Additionally, I’m in touch with Foresight Institute for joining or sponsoring their Space Workshop 2023 in June in California (<https://foresight.org/foresight-space-workshop-2023/>).\n\n      7. Suited to this I created a framework for MoonDAO members to start their own Science Fiction Prototyping workshops and working groups. For future workshops, this is the online source where we can source Sci-Fi concepts (<http://www.technovelgy.com/>).\n\n      8. I added an outline of Future Studies plus Science & Technology Studies topics & Techniques for members to educate themselves.\n\n4. **Key Result**: Task 5.4 Drive more Rapid Prototyping/Additive Manufacturing Professionals to MoonDAO with knowledge in 3D modeling and Simulations to support the Space Engineering Guild\n\n   1. **Results**: [3D printing service USA cities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B8ieWsGTa0apZPnegVtLxlENuaITWgpMNit6C6TMFr0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Learnings:**\n\n      1. I had chats with professional Hardware prototypers focusing on robotics and energy system. Sadly there was no concrete use case and value for these professionals to join our weekly SEG meetings. Despite the fact that it was 2 am for European connections.\n\n      2. With the push of ESA Lunar Tender and other MoonDAO projects in the pipeline, I believe it will be more logical for experts to join MoonDAO for contribution and incentivization.\n\n      3. Additionally I added a list of hardware prototyping facilities in the US for future outreach.\n\n5. **Key Result**: Task 5.5 Connect more Intellectual Property attorneys focusing on Spacetech with MoonDAO\n\n   1. **Results**: [IP Strategy Checklist by wipo.int](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sr4NS80s9VTzEKo4Tunhz_U6GJ5PGTanNSuSxQDtaWE/edit?usp=sharing) [Directory of Intellectual Property Offices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131qXXv0ItSOKW2Qec0zQXVJt8N39-_rouQgHCNTDuUc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Learnings:**\n\n      1. I had chats with IP attorneys about regional and space-related specifications in IP markets. Sadly these people are super busy and super high paid so it’s not useful for us right now to actively attract this group to MoonDAO. This will be more valuable if we want to further commercialize IP or lay out licensing agreements or hold IP as a DAO.\n\n      2. We need to work on a Governance Framework for IP globally tailored to the Space industry and web3 ethos of transparency and data ownership with Cyber Security and ITAR experts (<https://www.wipo.int/technology-transfer/en/ip-policies.html>).\n\n6. **Key Result**: Additional useful Databases\n\n   1. **Results**: [DeSpace Ecosystem](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iStym4Y5hfGjBg4CITGleujqxsyAIPn5UI0HpjkuFmE/edit?usp=sharing) [Space Agencies Worldwide WIP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceShh6WKS7w4tTPhpqyX_OkdzVbYr5UA4b34_VMtP1U/edit?usp=sharing) [FI Spacetech Ecosystem](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qAgRl2U0zHYe3GBy_UhsF0kED66xJ6zD2U3e7XDE0ik/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Learnings:**\n\n      1.
