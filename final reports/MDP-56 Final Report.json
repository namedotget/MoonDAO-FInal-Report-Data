  "body": "# **Social Media Project Final Report****Summary**\n\n## This project was a step towards figuring out how to do secret sharing in a trust-less way so that individual projects could have direct access to social accounts to make posts about their project announcements and other updates. The project successfully used LastPass to manage these secrets, and so far we have not had any leak of the passwords and have maintained security despite the risks involved with sharing these accounts with others.Along with Twitter and LinkedIn there were also many posts on Instagram (1.7k followers with 256 follower increase over the last 90 days) and YouTube (600 followers with 77 subs over 90 days).We’ve also bought a typefully subscription for teams to add their project’s updates directly onto socials to have their updates reviewed before being posted.\n\n# **Original Proposal**\n\n[MDP-76: Increase Social Media Reach and Security\\\n****](https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth/proposal/0x0fa3f19117320b189c2e742ae4071f929054f6181eb45a84b7757a46f4b28456)**Results**1. **Objective #1:** Increase overall engagement on social media channels, and funnel people into our Discord for community onboarding.\n\n   1. **Key Result 1**: _Twitter Followers increase by 20% on a quarterly basis_\n\n      1. **_Members: Pablo, Ryan_**\n\n      2. **_Results:_**\n\n         1. **_November: +515_**\n\n         2. **_December: +7,000_**\n\n         3. **_January: -95_**\n\n         4. **_February: -695_**\n\n         5. **_March: -631_**\n\n         6. **_April: -424_**\n\n         7. **_May: -177_**\n\n         8. **_June: -406_**\n\n      3. **_Learnings:_** _Probably a lot of bot followers when we did the token listings. Would be interesting to get an idea of verified users to get a cleaner metric on social media growth. It would be great to get better statistics on all our social channels so we can clearly measure the impact._\n\n      4. **_Maintenance:_** _Still need to post on Twitter to continue growth._\n\n      5. **_Self-reported Score: 0.4_** _There probably was some growth, but because Twitter killed a lot of the bots, overall we’re probably flat._\n\n   2. **_Key Result 2:_** _LinkedIn followers are up to 5,000 people within the quarter._\n\n      1. **_Members:_** _Ryan_\n\n      2. **_Results:_** \n\n         1. _534 Followers in Total. This quarter: 907 page views, 400 unique visitors._\n\n         2. _120 new followers in the last 90 days. 30% growth._\n\n      3. **_Learnings:_** _Still need more consistency with the content, traction through some of our other socials. Biggest boost was through ZeroG when there was a flurry of activity. 5k growth was an extremely ambitious goal, still had 30% growth which is a positive framing of it._\n\n      4. **_Maintenance:_** _Still need to post on LinkedIn to continue growth._\n\n      5. **_Self-reported Score: 0.3_**\n\n   3. **_Key Result 3:_** _Increase Guild onboarding requests by 50%._\n\n      1. **_Members: Ryan, Pablo_**\n\n      2. **_Results:_** _Not sure how many guild onboarding requests we’ve had then v.s. now. Will need to check in with Stewards._\n\n      3. **_Learnings:_** _Better metrics collection and tracking of onboarding requests and numbers._\n\n      4. **_Maintenance:_** _None._\n\n      5. **_Self-reported Score:_** _?_2) **Objective #2:** Give access to social media for projects to increase their awareness in a secure manner.\n\n   1. **Key Results for Objective #2**: _Set up a secure protocol for onboarding project marketers to our social channels, and have a risk mitigation strategy if passwords are breached or someone is using the tool in a way that is not beneficial for the DAO._\n\n      1. **_Members: Pablo, Ryan_**\n\n      2. **_Results:_** _Gave secure password access to twitter and instagram to Lucas and Ari_\n\n      3. **_Learnings:_** _Lastpass can work for us going forward, but the UI for secret sharing can be clunky and limited._\n\n      4. **_Maintenance:_** _Continue to be conscious of who has access and remove access as needed from socials._\n\n      5. **_Self-reported Score:_** _0.8_\n-----------------------------------------\n\n# **Team Member Contributions**\n\n### **Pablo @pmoncada**\n\n## 1. **Objective:** Increase overall engagement on social media channels, and funnel people into our Discord for community onboarding.\n\n   1. **Key Result**: _Twitter Followers increase by 20% on a quarterly basis_\n\n      1. **Specific Contribution**: Made 90%+ of all Twitter posts to keep the community informed and engaged about MoonDAO\n\n      2. **Impact:** I’m the only one posting on Twitter on a consistent basis, so without this we would not have any engagement on our main social platform.\n\n      3. **Complexity:** It takes up a lot of time to be engaged on social media.\n\n2. **Objective #2:** Give access to social media for projects to increase their awareness in a secure manner.\n\n   1. **Key Results for Objective #2**: _Set up a secure protocol for onboarding project marketers to our social channels, and have a risk mitigation strategy if passwords are breached or someone is using the tool in a way that is not beneficial for the DAO._\n\n      1. **Specific Contribution**: This has been set up and is operational.\n\n      2. **Impact:** Completed.\n\n      3. **Complexity:** Took a few days of testing and letting people get access to get a feel for it. Lastpass is pretty complicated but we were able to get it to where we need.\n\n### **Ryan @ryand2d**\n\n## 3. **Objective:** Increase overall engagement on social media channels, and funnel people into our Discord for community onboarding.\n\n   1. **Key Result**: _Instagram Posts_\n\n      1. **Specific Contribution**: 13 posts, 159 stories, 3 reels.\n\n      2. **Impact:** 11.2k accounts reached (+1,194%), 672 accounts engaged (+1,001%), and 1,770 followers (+16.9%) in past ninety days (vs previous 90 days)\n\n      3. **Complexity:** \n\n   2. **Key Result**: _YouTube Activity_\n\n      1. **Specific Contribution:** 15 live streams, 2 videos, 1 short.\n\n      2. **Impact:** _1.1k views (+243%), 54 hours watch time (+610%) +77 subscribers._\n\n      3. **Complexity:** Livestreams were usually broadcasting weekly town halls or senate meetings via streamyard, one special live event for ZeroG, creation of short via Canva for Lifeship.\n\n# **Coordinape Results**\n\n## Link: N/A Distributed between team|                 |                        |                     |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Member Name** | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** |\n| @pmoncada       | 50                     | 0 MVP               |\n| @ryan           | 50                     | 0 MVP               |\n\n# **Treasury Transparency**\n\n## No Treasury on this one.Two transactions need to be initiated from the multisig:1) 1000 DAI, 100k MOONEY Payment to Ryan for his MVP.\n\n2) Payment to Pablo to cover 1 year of LastPass, and 1 year of Typefully.\n\n   1.
