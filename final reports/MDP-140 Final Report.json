  "body": "# **MoonDAO Entities (aka. Citizens & Teams): Final Report**\n\n\n# **Original Proposal**\n\n**Link to Original Proposal:**[**MDP-140: MoonDAO Entities Go-To-Market**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6Qyrx3W9GBa6Ci_OHSuTpvIfw4EDyqbYMi_4-7n7Mg/edit?usp=sharing)****\\\n**Original Abstract:**In [MDP-126: MoonDAO Entity Creation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WjfiuoejqPf1WSNeHq32UpYaqkWeOBY2wa2TP3685mk/edit#heading=h.piq12i6l9hzn) we set out to create a simple method for individuals and organizations to join MoonDAO in one click. We achieved this, and a demo was presented to the DAO: [MoonDAO Q1 2024 Final Reports & Demos](https://youtu.be/gYv1LixZrQY?si=h2O6lY3NgGw8Jo5s\\&t=759)\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nNow, our task is to roll this out to users in a way to seed the network, bootstrapping around our pre-existing MoonDAO Members and partners, and continue to improve and build on the system using feedback from real-world users.\n\n\n# **Results**\n\n1. **Objective: Onboard a high-quality set of Foundation Series Entities to seed the MoonDAO Network**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Onboard 10 high-quality organizations from existing MoonDAO Network\n\n      1. **Results**: Eight organizations have accepted our invitation to join the first MoonDAO teams cohort. Three are still pending acceptance (in parenthesis)\n\n         1. Open Lunar\n\n         2. Intuitive Machines¬†\n\n         3. Lifeship\n\n         4. Space For A Better World\n\n         5. The Mars Society\n\n         6. Aethero Space\n\n         7. Earthlight Foundation\n\n         8. LunARK\n\n         9. (Lonestar)\n\n         10. (iSpace)\n\n         11. (The Inspired24)\n\nOut of these eleven organizations that we reached out to 6 are non-profits (Open Lunar, Space For a Better World, The Mars Society, Earthlight Foundation, LunARK, The Inspired24), and 5 are for-profits (Intuitive Machines, Lifeship, Aethero Space, Lonestar, iSpace). Two organizations are interested but will wait for now (Karman Fellowship, and ICON).\n\n2. **Learnings**: Almost all sales were closed on the first call. The response was great. We reached out to 13 organizations in total, 8 confirmed, 3 pending, 2 decided to wait for a future cohort or were unsure if their organization could participate, but are still interested. No one said no explicitly. Most calls were with the CEO/Founder, the only two cases where it was with a non-decision maker we were told they weren‚Äôt sure if their org could participate. Starting the sales cycle earlier may have given us a little more breathing room to reach out to more organizations and not rush at the end.\n\n3. **Maintenance**: They‚Äôll be able to onboard with a private link this week, and we‚Äôll work closely with them as they go through the onboarding process.\n\n2) **Key Result**: Promote each of the onboarded members with high-quality visibility threads\n\n   1. **Results**: Future work. This project focused on closing the sales, but we haven‚Äôt launched anything publicly about the teams we‚Äôre working with.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: N/A****\n\n3) **Key Result**: Gather real-world feedback on the Entity System\n\n   1. **Results**: We usually started the calls by focusing on what the primary pain-points are for the organizations, and then let them drive the call and we presented the teams framework in response to existing problems they were facing. I don‚Äôt think we collected a feedback doc, but many of the features we decided to add and focus on (marketplace, hiring, funding) came from those three recurring reasons for why an entity would like to join.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: N/A****\n\n4) **Key Result**: Maintain our systems and have development be driven by user feedback\n\n   1. **Results**: This will be ongoing work. Maintenance and bug fixing will happen in a follow-on proposal, long term it will be maintained by the Executive Branch.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: N/A****\n\n**Grade:**¬† _Meets Expectations._ We onboarded eight high-quality organizations, and are waiting on a response from three more. If we reach 11 we can change this to exceeds üôÇ****\n\n2. **Objective: Seed the Citizen Network with high-quality MoonDAO Members from our existing base**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Onboard 100 high-quality citizens from our existing MoonDAO Network\n\n      1. **Results**: No citizens have been onboarded yet. The signup flow will be active this week and open to the first batch of citizens.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: We were rushing at the end to complete the onboarding process, we had to totally reinvent the image generator portion since that was not done properly in the last quarter (the code was 10,000 lines and constantly crashed and caused bugs throughout the app). Also, we focused much more on organizations and citizens took a back seat. We added many more features to entities like the marketplace, jobs board, and wrangled with hats protocol for a while. This took longer than expected. Some criteria were put together to onboard citizens, but unfortunately the development work was not completed in time to onboard people in the app.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: Maintenance and bug fixing will happen in a follow-on proposal, long term it will be maintained by the Executive Branch.\n\n2) **Key Result**: Promote each of the individuals who have joined MoonDAO if they share on socials.\n\n   1. **Results**: Future Work.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: N/A****\n\n3) **Key Result**: Gather real-world feedback on the Citizen System\n\n   1. **Results**: A survey was created that received 27 responses\\\n      ([MoonDAO Citizen Market Research Survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17RFDVFfULDFImDRHqiOLMce5-RtRZ9kA4Cd6dJt0-1Q/edit#heading=h.nz0lwf9xaa95)). Summary of responses and insights can be seen here: [Citizen/Entity Onboarding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oB1EOmCUXNCAxxT2NkZQUsyF73yS1TngOFu47_zfMAw/edit)\n\n   2. **Learnings**: This was an initial outreach survey to learn about the appeal of such a system, price point, etc. Real world feedback on the Citizen platform is still TBD.\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: Maintenance and bug fixing will happen in a follow-on proposal, long term it will be maintained by the Executive Branch.****\n\n4) **Key Result**: Maintain our systems and have development be driven by user feedback\n\n   1. **Results**: This will be ongoing work. Maintenance and bug fixing will happen in a follow-on proposal, long term it will be maintained by the Executive Branch.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: Maintenance and bug fixing will happen in a follow-on proposal, long term it will be maintained by the Executive Branch.****\n\n**Grade:**¬† _Does not meet expectations._ Although I think we will reach 100 citizens in the next few months, it was ambitious to think we could scale to that level before the end of the quarter. Development timelines were longer than anticipated, so even today citizens cannot yet sign up.****\n\n3. **Objective: Improve our UI/UX for the Entity and Citizen onboarding and throughout the app**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Improve the aesthetics of the app throughout\n\n      1. **Results**: The app saw a full redesign from the ground up and all the design elements were custom made and implemented throughout the entities page, citizens page, onboarding, and various modals throughout the app.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: We did some work to hire a new UI/UX developer and started outreach, but ultimately we decided to hire internally and have Mitchie lead the design work. Mitchie learned tailwind, react, and next.js on the job to complete this work, and although there was a learning curve, by the end of the project he was able to complete all the designs in the app.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: Maintenance and bug fixing will happen in a follow-on proposal, long term it will be maintained by the Executive Branch.\n\n2) **Key Result**: Decrease the number of clicks or difficulty of finding things throughout the app\n\n   1. **Results**: Subjectively, the new designs feel much more intuitive and simple to navigate, but it‚Äôs hard to quantify that. The sidebar navigation has been cleaned up a lot, and little design quirks have been fixed. Currently there are 23 clicks from start to finish to create a citizen or entity, and we will continue trying to simplify that process. [Number of Clicks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XmxfgmK7zRmbehCoRfEtjRNvggAviH904EtBhrwuZkY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: Maintenance and bug fixing will happen in a follow-on proposal, long term it will be maintained by the Executive Branch.\n\n**Grade:**¬† _Exceeds Expectations._¬†\n\n\n# **Member Contributions**\n\n**@pmoncada:** Rocketeer / Project Leader. Held daily standups to navigate next steps and coordinate work across dev, sales, and design. Primary ‚Äúsalesman‚Äù with entities. Authored the initial scope of the project and led the strategy for execution.\n\n**@ryand2d:**Strategizing around the initial roll out, pricing: [Citizen Membership Pricing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f9W-8lL3435deIparK4vW5Wn03bsFvFTgjdCr5673lI/edit?usp=sharing), 1:1 outreach to survey potential citizens about what aspects appeal the most, things that appeal to them, changing copy such as [join page](https://moondao-ce-demo.netlify.app/join) to reflect, and changing branding for wider appeal. Further strategizing around GTM, framing the offer, pricing + roll out: [Citizen/Entity Onboarding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oB1EOmCUXNCAxxT2NkZQUsyF73yS1TngOFu47_zfMAw/edit) (see also detailed survey insights here). Strategizing with Pablo on which entities to target for initial cohort, outreach and meeting booking, assisting during demo sales calls that Pablo led, following up with entities. View restricted: [Citizen Onboarding Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZGWcbsdaNoRK2zVCuOae5OJy6jV3R-OV97Vd6Y3_Fa0/edit)& [Entity Outreach Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t3TOJpaZdy8Cj-4V4_hxLVbNiHR3b9Mr5p9tACDToes/edit). Some initial outreach to potential citizens from the linked tracker. Finding lots of app bugs and design issues.**@name.get:** As a fullstack developer I implemented the Marketplace feature, enabling Teams to buy and sell items.¬† I also developed Manager functions for Teams, providing enhanced management capabilities.¬† Additionally, I helped improve the styling of the Citizen, Team and Network pages/components to create a more cohesive and user-friendly interface.¬† I also refactored several components to enhance readability, maintainability and performance.**@sheldenshi:** Smart contract implementation and test. This includes integrating Hats Protocol for role management, and Tableland for on-chain database to the citizen/entity subscription contracts. Citizen image generation.**@mitchie\\_mitch:** Contributed web design, graphic design, and development skills for all relevant pages including the welcome page, as well as feedback and feature ideation.
