  "body": "# **Second Astronaut Selection Extension: Final Report**\n\n\n# **Original Proposal**\n\n**Link to Original Proposal:** \n\n[MDP-121: Second Astronaut Selection Extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_GeyqrF2v9BYH1LTDWzeYRwhUuabgCVXiZOMLrNtfpA/edit?usp=sharing)\\\n**Original Abstract:** \n\nThis project allocates one month of funding for two developers to continue supporting the second astronaut selection.\n\n\n# **Results**\n\nThe scope of this project was to complete the rest of the selection process. While the selection occurred on January 12th, there was a long process of reviewing the winners and communicating with them and Blue Origin. The final announcement was delayed because of a longer than expected review process.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n1. **Objective:  Complete the Second Astronaut Selection with minimal technical issues**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: 99% uptime for the project, bugs caught before reaching production\n\n      1. **Results**: The project closed up successfully and the selection process went smoothly.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: The selection page is still up, can be taken down later via the executive branch webmaster\n\n2) **Key Result**: Response time to tickets from the community in less than 24 hours by devs\n\n   1. **Results**: A new ticketing bot was added after the spect bot for Discord stopped working, the new ticketing bot was added and new issues were responded to promptly.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: Don’t rely on very early startups for critical infrastructure.\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: N/A****\n\n3) **Key Result**: Selection process is smooth, no unexpected issues\n\n   1. **Results**: 100%. No problems for the selection from a technical perspective. Everything worked flawlessly.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: N/A****\n\n4) **Key Result**: Project winds-down successfully with minimal technical debt incurred\n\n   1. **Results**: The only thing left is to close out the “sweepstakes” tab in the MoonDAO App. Right now the winners can see their spot in the app.\n\n   2. **Learnings**: N/A\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: Remove the “sweepstakes” tab.****\n\n**Grade:**  _Superb_\n\nThis objective has been added retroactively, it was on the original sweepstakes project and was rolled into this project\n\n2. **Objective: Select MoonDAO’s second Astronaut.**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Coordinate with Blue Origin, sweepstakes lawyers, and winners for the final review process.\n\n      1. Results: Several weeks of coordination with Blue Origin, and coordinating with candidates.\n\n   2. **Key Result:** Announce the final winner\n\n      1. Results: We were going to announce on the 27th of March, but a logistical hurdle impeded the announcement. Going to announce soon once that is resolved.\n\n   3. **Learnings:** Give extra space for winner announcement for unexpected hurdles.\n\n   4. **Maintenance:** Next steps will be more of a campaign around the second astronaut.\n\n   5. **Grade:** Meets Expectations\n\n\n# **Member Contributions**\n\n**@pmoncada:** I led the development team for the execution of the sweepstakes, and also handled communication with Blue Origin for the review process and worked closely with Ryan to put together an announcement of the selection livestream, and also announcement of the winner (still pending).\n\n**@\\_\\_mustang\\_\\_:** Worked with Colin and Larrotiz on creating the selection frontend. Also worked on the database, verifying that the contract data was reflected in the database so that the selection process was good from a user experience and dev experience.\n\n**@larrotiz:** Maintained the minting frontend. Worked with Pablo to create an alternative method of minting through ETH mainnet. Worked with Daniel and Colin on creating the selection frontend.\n\n**@name.get:** Created the initial frontend for the sweepstakes and tested the contract.\n\n**@ryand2d:** Coordinating the livestream selection event, creation of media and videos for the [live selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lHG1-nAckQ) event, led the deep dive analysis of our winning NFT selection winners and the sweepstakes rules for compliance, did the 1:1 outreach for personal info to our winners, compiling legal names, addresses, IDs, bios, etc, working with Blue Origin on the same. Prepped for a second livestream announcement to introduce the winner but had a last minute delay (still pending).\n\n\n# **Reward Distribution**\n\n[Link to the Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/circles/30645/give)\n\n|                  |                        |                     |                                            |                                            |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| **Member Name**  | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** | **Wallet to receive ETH**                  | **Wallet to receive MOONEY**               |\n| _@pmoncada_      | 18.78                  | 0                   | pmoncada.eth                               | pmoncada.eth                               |\n| @\\_\\_mustang\\_\\_ | 21.84                  | 1.31266 ETH         | 0x1B7D7d183Bd233af690DDB33cE818f41995118a9 | 0x1B7D7d183Bd233af690DDB33cE818f41995118a9 |\n| @larrotiz        | 20.2                   | 1.31266 ETH         | larrotiz.eth                               | larrotiz.eth                               |\n| @name.get        | 23.88                  | 0                   | namedotget.eth                             | namedotget.eth                             |\n| @ryand2d         | 15.31                  | 0                   | 0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99 | 0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99 |\n\n\n# **Treasury Transparency**\n\n[Link to Treasury](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth%3A0x59Ae8A0a6f20C918d2558B5624e25BABbD659Bba) \n\n_This multisig was reused from the previous sweepstakes project.
