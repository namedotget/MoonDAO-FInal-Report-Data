It is hosted on Obsidian Publish and uses a GitHub repository as a backup source. This project succeeded in all its objectives except remapping the domain, where we have to settle for a redirect from docs.moondao.com to publish.obsidian.md/moondao.\n\n## Results\n\n1. **Objective:** Replace the existing [**docs site**](https://github.com/Official-MoonDao/documentation) with the MoonDAO Knowledge Vault at docs.moondao.com\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Obsidian Publish license obtained by (or on behalf of) MoonDAO\n\n      1. **Results**: Obsidian Publish license obtained by phil\\@moondao.com\n\n      2. **Learnings**: The Obsidian customer service team is very responsive, friendly, and helpful. Obsidian Publish itself was very easy to set up. Certain Obsidian accounts (emails) can be whitelisted to have Publish rights, as in choosing what is or is not synced, but only <phil@moondao.com> has permission to change the site settings (navigation layout, excluded folders, etc).\n\n      3. **Maintenance**:\n\n         1. Yearly fee of $58.40, expires 9/3/2024\n\n         2. Yearly renewal of non-profit status, expires 9/20/2024\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Pablo**: 0.1\\\n         **Phil**: 0.9****\n\n   2. **Key Result**: MoonDAO Knowledge Vault is a GitHub repository owned by [Official-MoonDao](https://github.com/Official-MoonDao)\n\n      1. **Results**: <https://github.com/Official-MoonDao/lunar-comms> \n\n      2. **Learnings**: Obsidian Sync (the first-party paid sync service) is faster and more resilient than Git syncing, which tended to get borked pretty easily when syncing multiple clients to the same branch. However, Sync does not allow branches. If multiple users wish to sync to the same vault, they must exclude folders from the sync process to keep them private.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: Syncing is a manual process. Someone who is synced to the vault (or has cloned it) must actively push new commits.\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**:  1\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Pablo**: 0\\\n         **Phil**: 1****\n\n   3. **Key Result**: MoonDAO Knowledge Vault contains equal content found at docs.moondao.com\n\n      1. **Results**: <https://publish.obsidian.md/moondao> Parity plus extras.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: Much easier to maintain than the other site, especially since the docs contents update immediately upon a whitelisted user Publishing. That said, Publish is also a manual-only action. Good and bad.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: Someone needs to keep pushing new content to the site for it to stay alive. This includes updating the pages themselves and also choosing to publish them.\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n      5. **Team Contributions** \\\n         **Pablo**: 0\\\n         **Phil**: 1****\n\n   4. **Key Result**: MoonDAO Knowledge Vault is accessible at docs.moondao.com instead of the current site\n\n      1. **Results**: docs.moondao.com redirects to the Obsidian Publish site. However, the URL of the docs has the base “publish.obsidian.md/moondao” and not “docs.moondao.com”.\n\n      2. **Learnings**:  Masking the domain is not possible with Obsidian Publish unless we host our DNS with cloudflare (we dont). So while we can make redirects from docs.moondao.com, we have to live with publish.obsidian.md showing up in the address bar.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: None\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 0.5\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Pablo**:  0.5\\\n         **Phil**: 0.5\n----------------------\n\n## Coordinape Results\n\n## [Link to the Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/)~~: Make the Astronauts the admin.~~ Not applicable.|                 |                        |                     |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Member Name** | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** |\n| **Pablo**       | 15%                    | n/a                 |\n| **Phil**        | 85%                    | n/a                 |\n\n## Project Wrap Up Checklist\n\n## - [ ] Added Project Final Report onto the Website Dashboard\n\n- [ ] Upload Final report to the Google Drive\n\n- [ ] Returned excess funds to the Treasury\n\n- [ ] Presented Final Report to Senate\n\n- [ ] Update Discord Roles\n\n- [ ] (if needed) Create documentation for users of the work, or people who will need to maintain the project once it is completed.",
