  "body": "# **101.xyz Final Report**\n\n**Abstract:** _We will design courselets for 101.xyz so anyone can earn nontransferrable badges and learn about MoonDAO_\n\n**_Motivation:_** _MoonDAO and other organizations are looking to provide educational content and also give a clearer picture about how they work and how people can contribute. These organizations also want a platform to better describe what they are and achieve more legitimacy in the eyes of the public._\n\n**_Specification:_** _Using the 101.xyz Course Builder, we would take prefabricated chunks of explanation and quizzes of 3-10 questions, and submit them (and translated versions) for approval and publication by the 101.xyz team. The planned courselets are described below in the Key Results._**_Benefits:_** _The core benefit for MoonDAO is having an asynchronous platform for outsiders and contributors to join in small steps and achieve quick victories, giving them a sense of satisfaction and providing the DAO with a way to qualify potential contributors for different funnels into guilds.This also advertises the DAO on 101.xyz_\n\n**_Risks:_** _The risks are that the badges are not issued or other bugs prevent the completion of courses. The risks for MoonDAO is that people might consider the badges as unintended tokenomics while they are intended as verifiable credentials._\n\n**Objectives and Key Results:**\n\n_Team will revise ordering and quiz question structures (8 pages of 50-200 words of explanation_\n\n_& 3-10 quiz questions with 4 multiple choice answers) within each courselet, translations will be directly from those final drafts_\n\n**Objective #1:** _Create a “What is MoonDAO” courselet_**Objective #2:** _Create a “How to Contribute?” courselet_\\\n**Objective #3:** _Create a “The History of MoonDAO” courselet_\\\n**Objective #4:** _Create a “The History of Space” courselet_\\\n**Objective #5:** _Create a “The Benefits and Limits of Space” courselet_\n\n**Objective #6:** _Create a “How Spacecraft Operate” courselet_\n\n**Results**\n\nDrafting the courses was moderately challenging, due to limitations of the platform. Primarily, there was a very low character limit for quiz questions. Additionally, while the proposed benefits and risks were met, there wasn’t a robust method of making the quizzes more failure-prone, which would increase the value of successfully acquiring those badges. Translation is still ongoing, so there is a question of how the 101.xyz flow works with non-Latin characters. Some issues were raised about auxiliary work like procuring graphics for the badges and translation services, so future proposals might need to account for that in the budget. In summary, all six courses were drafted, uploaded, and are being actively completed by public users.\n\n- What is MoonDAO - <https://101.xyz/course/clagumhuq1278108moxp6iqpji> \n\n- The History of MoonDAO - <https://101.xyz/course/clau844132344508mn5liunen7> \n\n- How to Contribute - <https://101.xyz/course/clau77hcj918408ld1xugyd2n> \n\n- Brief History of Space - <https://101.xyz/course/clbkbgs8d400240fl8q7w6sxnh> \n\n- Benefits & Limits of Space - <https://101.xyz/course/cl8exnvjw146209man9iey8cg> \n\n- How Spacecraft Operate - <https://101.xyz/course/clb4h5qyf482708kx81xyp2v1>\n\n- 什么是MoonDAO - <https://101.xyz/course/clc4y50820029mm0fjshzksj0> \n\n- MoonDAO历史 - <https://101.xyz/course/clc4zh7rg000gmh0fxowe15iu> \n\n- 在MoonDAO贡献 - <https://101.xyz/course/clc50jnh50004mp0fohg3iyva> \n\n- Number of completions (respectively as of Dec 27: 1865, 2057,1862, 1716, 1891,1801, 220, 153, 164)\n\n**Non-Bounty Contributions**\n\n**@cheesebeard**\n\n- Text content and questions for courses 4-6: “The History of Space,” “The Benefits and Limits of Space,” and “How Spacecraft Operate.”\n\n- Badge image format idea and creation of four badges: #1 and 4-6. \n\n- Formatting and uploading all content to 101.xyz platform.\n\n- Account creation and administration role within 101.xyz\n\n**@ryand2d**\n\n- Drafted text content and questions for courses 1-3: “What is MoonDAO,” “How to Contribute?” and “The History of MoonDAO.”\n\n- Badge images for two courses: #2 for history of moondao and #3 for contributions\n\n**@barney**\n\n- Translated content & questions for courses 1-6\n\n**@ballack**\n\n- Translated “What is MoonDAO” & “History of MoonDAO”\n\n- Provided feedback\n\n- Promoted first three translations to CN Community\n\n**@larrotiz**\n\n- xxx\n\n**Important Details for Future Contributions and Costs**\n\n- Future edit and admin access?",
