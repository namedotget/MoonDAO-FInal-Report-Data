Together with MoonDAO I am also launching Open Hardware Space Engineering Working Groups to create a positive impact on our environment. So ReFi is also on my table!Would love to get in touch and learn more about your company.Cold greetings from Davos,Manuel_2. Besides that, I collected content from Twitter and Linkedin about the events I visited and who posted what. With this, I identified Key decision-makers like the Filecoin executive team, Casper Labs, Polygon, and Lockheed Martin.\n\n3. I met 86 people in Davos and followed up with everyone over a period of 1 ½ months and 5 email later.

MoonDAO is at the forefront of governance, space, and crypto. At Davos we have the opportunity to be thought leaders in decentralized uniting community space movements. As a team we represented this new domain well, made strong connections, and planted the seeds for having a big impact on the world stage. We learned our way around Davos and met the people to continue to launch decentralized space.Recommended that we begin planning about 6 months ahead next year and create a series of panels and bring together leaders from different organizations to really launch these movements and put decentralized community space movements that unite humanity in people’s awareness. \\\n**Objective #1:** Present and Represent MoonDAO__**Key Results for Objective #1**: 1) **Member(s)**: Ben Haldeman\n\n2) **Results**: Brought up community space movements into the conversation through questions in panels and networking conversations. Made meaningful high level introductions for pmoncada that hopefully will bear fruit in the future. Framed decentralized space and community movements as a major, growing, and underrepresented movement.**Objective #2:** Recruit space community members and business leaders into MoonDAO1) **Member(s)**: _Ben Haldeman_\n\n2) **Results**: Raised awareness for MoonDAO and community space. Conversations with VCs, CEOs of public companies, and other high level business leaders intros. Many will not be members but elevated the conversation. Many of these may not lead to fruit today but we are building a big global movement for humanity. We are setting the stage for MoonDAO to be part of the big conversations.**Objective #3:** Explore Organizational Partnerships and Revenue Opportunities 1) **Member(s)**: _Ben Haldeman_\n\n2) **Results**: Conversations and relationship building for future opportunities.**Objective #4:** Create Report on Conference Outcomes1. **Key Results for Objective #4**: Inform the Dao on the latest business, political, and technological drivers being shared by world leaders.1) **Member(s)**: _Ben Haldeman_\n\n2) **Results**: See this doc! \n==============================\n\n### **@pmoncada**\n\n# 1. **Objective #2:** Recruit space community members and business leaders into MoonDAO\n\n   1. **KR:** Inspire at least five individuals with Space backgrounds to become MoonDAO members.\n\n      1. **Specific Contribution:** I spoke to many people about MoonDAO and got their cards, and followed up with them.\n\n         1. Hank Holiday from Quorum 1. Had a great call with their org and am now a member of theirs, will try to convert them into MoonDAO members.\n\n         2. Lucian Tarnowski: From United Planet. Attended his event and spoke to many people there. I am not sure if he officially became a MoonDAO member. Will need to follow up with him.\n\n         3. Iker Puente: Instituto Transpersonal Integrativa. Many conversations but also not sure if he ended up becoming a MoonDAO member.\n\n         4. Will Marshall CEO of Planet Labs. This was a connection of Ben’s will be going to more of their events in the bay area and convert him into a MoonDAO member.\n\n         5. Revathi: Founder of ReGen and research initiatives. Followed up with her but did not convert to MoonDAO member.\n\n         6. Jonathan Barry: Chairman of EarthTrust.Fund\n\n         7. Maria Nova: Movie director\n\n         8. Valesca Hernadez: Marketing professional\n\n         9. Dan Hwang: Blockchain expert.\n\n         10. Dominique: ZeroG possible conversion.\n\n         11. Daniela Herrmann: Interested in creating her own DAO. Haven’t followed up with her yet.\n\n      2. **Impact:** Although connections were made, I’m not sure if any conversions to MOONEY holders were made. Need better metrics on conversions. These are all more long term relationships and I don’t want to be pushy about getting them into MoonDAO.\n\n      3. **Complexity:** Attending many events. Many conversations.\n\n2. **Objective #3:** Explore Organizational Partnerships and Revenue Opportunities\n\n   1. **KR:** Develop at least 3 leads for options for partnership in growth, technology, and the space program.\n\n      1. **Specific Contribution:** There are many opportunities on the horizon for partnerships with Filecoin, CERN. We attended a presentation with Lockheed about their lunar activities too. Need to build out our partnerships program more and officially onboard them.\n\n      2. **Impact:** None yet, these need to be developed further with more conversations.\n\n      3. **Complexity:** Follow up conversations and organizing those meetings can be operationally complex. I think we need to compile a list of all the contacts a little further. Manuel has done this.\n\n# **Coordinape Results**\n\n# <https://app.coordinape.com/circles/5331>Ben and Ari did not fill out the Coordinape.
