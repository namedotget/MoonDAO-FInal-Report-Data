This drastically reduced the impact of gas fees from 40 USD(yearly ath) to 0,17 USD for staking MOONEY, and from 2,000 usd to 15 usd for the Q1 and Q2 distributions. This proposal implemented a polygon multi-sig for the treasury, deployed the stake to vote smart contract on Polygon, and ran tests to our multi-chain future, also implementing a custom voting strategy on snapshot.**\n\n## Results\n\n1. **Objective:  Implement Stake to Vote on Polygon**\n\n   1. **Key Result**:Edit the stake to vote smart contract and find solutions to possible bugs\n\n      1. **Results**: We choose to keep the original contract for security measures considering that we were doing Q1 and Q2 distributions on L2.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: Its important to be safe, especially after recent hacks.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: None\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Colin**: Advised that we should keep the original contract**Pablo**: Advised that we should keep the original contract2. **Key Result**: Deploy the smart contract on Mumbai testnet and run it with a 85% success rate  and polygon mainnet\n\n   1. **Results**: We were able to deploy it twice successfully on testnet, and also deployed [on Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe2d1BFef0A642B717d294711356b468ccE68BEa6).\n\n   2. **Learnings**: Testnets can work different from the mainnet on L2s, there are no safe app for mumbai, and some things need to be tested on mainnet..\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: None\n\n   4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n   5. **Team Contributions\\\n      Colin**: Deployed the final version and debugged**Lucas**: Deployed the 1st version and debugged, bridged L2 Mooney****          **Key Result**: Provide training material about how to stake Mooney on polygon without the dedicated frontend3) **Results**: No needed, we deployed an[ L2 front end](https://main--moondao-app-expansion-test.netlify.app/lock).\n\n4) **Learnings**: Some things dont work using block explorers, we needed to deploy a frontend for L2.\n\n5) **Maintenance**: Make it live to the broader community.\n\n6) **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 0.6\n\n7) **Team Contributions\\\n   Colin**: Deployed the front end, tested and debugged**Lucas**: Testing and debugging2. **Objective: Implement a Multi-chain voting strategy**\n\n   1. **Results**: The multi-chain vote is live on snapshot..\n\n   2. **Learnings**: It's important to mention that snapshot already has a bunch of strategies, most of the time its not worth to build an strategy from 0.\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: None\n\n   4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n   5. **Team Contributions\\\n      Pablo**: Set up the strategy**Lucas**: Research, tested and Assisted setting up the strategy3. **Objective: Create a matic  multi-sig for the MoonDAO treasury**\n\n   1. **Results**: Implemented [here](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=matic:0x8C0252c3232A2c7379DDC2E44214697ae8fF097a).\n\n   2. **Learnings**: We can swap tokens easly directly on multi-sigs using the uniswap integrated dapp.\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: None\n\n   4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n   5. **Team Contributions****Lucas**: Set up the multi-sig.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Coordinape Results\n\n## [Link to the Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/circles/17548/give): Make the Astronauts the admin.|                 |                        |                     |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Member Name** | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** |\n| **Colin**       | 35                     | 0                   |\n| **Lucas**       | 45                     | 0                   |\n| **Pablo**       | 20                     | 0                   |\n\n## Treasury Transparency\n\n## **No upfront budget** \n",
