This proposal has two chief goals, 1) weekly email updates and 2) rewriting most of our onboarding drip sequences / flow to reflect the changes made to onboarding/joining MoonDAO in Q4 2023\n\n\n# **Results**\n\n_12 weekly emails sent out with MoonDAO and space news updates (_[_can be seen here_](https://moondao.ck.page/posts)_), including before this no-MVP project had officially been approved in the Senate. Subscribers are up quarter over quarter, but have been trending down for the past couple of weeks as we lose the traffic or inflows generated by the Ticket to Space._ \n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n_The actual way to subscribe to the newsletter is also very hidden or buried, visible in the footer of moondao.com so that also contributes to falling levels of new subs._\n\n**_**_![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXezxsjIIrx1sV7NjWyfd7MUgSUZxVWemDrEAPHdNH3P8_yaNgQ937MWxn5YipG8Z5T-uW7ZRnqzspSGauHibltERtWdB-1MwtbG1G-AE9n3xNJtjNoy0ZRhPsia6hF77t0bJxdIssd3EcpT1j9dCBxd5qU?key=gArRYOw52CZVz71rLJ4-aw)_**_**\n\n1. **Objective: Weekly Mooney Monday Emails**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Weekly Mooney Monday emails again with space news, and MoonDAO updates, such as those seen on the [public MoonDAO emails page](https://moondao.ck.page/posts)\n\n      1. **Results**: _Weekly Mooney Monday emails, sometimes Tuesday, were sent. Email updates can be seen at_ [_https://moondao.ck.page/profile_](https://moondao.ck.page/profile) _there were also some one-off email communications related to the sweepstakes that were sent._\n\n      2. **Learnings**: _Creating a system for MoonDAO projects to submit quick updates that could potentially be included in the newsletter would be a good way to generate content, highlight those projects, and remove some of that onus from the writer._\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: _This work is going to be rolled into the executive branch role going forward._\n\n**Grade:**  _Meets Expectations_****\n\n2. **Objective:**  **Revamp Autoresponder Sequences**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Make some pretty significant changes and rewrites to our onboarding email sequences / drips to ensure that they reflect the new reality of MoonDAO Mission Control and the ease of joining\n\n      1. **Results**: Failed to do this before the deadline.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: Was tight on time with other projects and did not prioritize this, had also been waiting for finalization of the Entity project and/or merging of the two MoonDAO sites, so those changes could be reflected in new write-ups.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: Still needs to be done.\n\n**Grade:**  Did not meet expectations.\n\n\n# **Member Contributions**\n\n@Ryand2d: _Wrote the email updates, managed ConvertKit, occasionally created graphics or images for use in the newsletter, maintenance work like tagging cold subs to reengage or deleting those who don’t to maintain an active user base and not waste subs on inactive accounts._\n\n\n# **Reward Distribution**\n\n|                 |                        |                     |                                            |                                              |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |\n| **Member Name** | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** | **Wallet to receive ETH**                  | **Wallet to receive MOONEY**                 |\n| @ryand2d        | 100%                   | NONE                | 0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99 | _0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99_ |",
