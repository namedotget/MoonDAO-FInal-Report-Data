In this regard the video was adapted with feedback from the onboarding improvement initiative and published on the introductory stage of the new onboarding flow as well as youtube and twitter.\n\n\n## Results\n\n1. **Objective:** _Render a high-quality video that explains key concepts of MoonDAO’s governance processes_\n\n   1. **Key Result**: _Video posted in the governance guide discord channel_\n\n      1. **Results**:\\\n         [Welcome to MoonDAO: Uniting Globally for Beyond-Earth Governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs_vAtRgaBA)\\\n         [Video Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D5m9yPvbGY5RCqfM7XJRX-oezrt7CdBvvLmuONOzDRc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n      2. **Learnings**: MoonDAO’s documentation and processes rely on many novel terms and jargon that makes it less accessible to everyday people. The analogy of MoonDAO as similar to an internet-native nation by exhibiting features such as a shared treasury, senate, voting system, economy, and constitution, intuitively resonates well with most people. \n\n      3. **Maintenance**: None\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: .8 \n\n      5. **Team Contributions**\n\nSpecial thanks to Ryan and Elijah for Feedback****\n\n2. **Key Result**: _Video posted on youtube and highlighted on twitter_ \n\n   1. **Results**: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs_vAtRgaBA) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OfficialMoonDAO/status/1725296003673203165) (Bonus: posted on [MoonDAO App](https://app.moondao.com/))\n\n   2. **Learnings**: The original intent of the project focused heavily on contributors and apating documentation, however more impact on accessibility was found by adapting the video for the onboarding flow.\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: None\n\n   4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n   5. **Team Contributions**\n\nThanks to Ryan for publication to twitter and youtube****\n\n\n## Coordinape Results\n\n|                 |                        |                     |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Member Name** | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** |\n| Mitchie         | 45                     | 0                   |\n| Ryan            | 3                      | 0                   |\n| Elijah          | 2                      | 0                   |\n| Sforz           | 50                     | 0                   |",
