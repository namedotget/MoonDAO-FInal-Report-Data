  "body": "# **Development Guild Final Report**\\\n**Summary**\n===========\n\n## One of the main challenges we’ve faced is balancing internal operations with outreach efforts. Our dev guild is small but committed, and is likely the most result-oriented guild. The guild has been successful in maintaining our current infrastructure and encouraging the development of new infrastructure. Most of the credit goes to Colin (name.get) who has stepped strongly into the lead role and generously dedicated his expertise and experience to MoonDAO’s needs. Honorary mention goes to Lucas-Ariel (cryptoariel) who voluntarily implemented UI changes and code refactorization and will be added into the coordinape.\n\n# **Results**\n\n1) **Objective**: **Create and maintain a pool of developers at MoonDAO**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Monitor onboarding form for interested developers and vet/interview them \n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Larrotiz, Mitchie\n\n      2. **Results**: [Onboarding overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-ynDywdMadwA7TaD0v4HEw-F7VtQshnot2NUm1S2JY/edit?usp=sharing)  5 members submitted guild onboarding form,\n\n      3. **Learnings:** We need to focus on improvements to the onboarding process (spect)\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Remove the form from website\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.22) **Key Result**: Onboard talented members with key skill sets\n\n   1. **Member(s)**: Larrotiz, Name.Get\n\n   2. **Results**: [Onboarding overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-ynDywdMadwA7TaD0v4HEw-F7VtQshnot2NUm1S2JY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n   3. **Learnings:** We need to focus on outreach. Solutions in the works include hackathons events and potential the Chief Ambassador\n\n   4. **Maintenance**:\n\n   5. **Team’s Self-Reported Score:** .62) **Objective: Encourage automated processes in the DAO (bring the “A” in DAO)**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Identify core technologies, tools, and techniques\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get\n\n      2. **Results: :** Researched various technologies, tools, and techniques that can be used to automate processes in the DAO\n\n      3. **Learnings:** There are many tools geared towards assisting communities but not too many that are specific to DAOs and decentralization.\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: 0\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.82) **Key Result**: Identify or incept the development of automation-oriented proposals \n\n   1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get, Mitchie\n\n   2. **Results**: [Guardian](https://github.com/colinmfoster4723/Guardian), [Snap Signal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/195XWChcq7ie3LkqPbhCAArVy91Oy886fJCDqgyNvdlA/edit), boto.io, astrobot, \\*Summary doc of identified automation needs\n\n   3. **Learnings:** More upfront research on future projects can help save time costs. \n\n   4. **Maintenance**: Low maintenance requirements, name.get will be continuing with the responsibilities of technical maintenance as necessary (outlined in the stewardship proposal)\n\n   5. **Team’s Self-reported Score: .9**3) **Key Result**: Direct and support proposal development\n\n   1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get, Mitchie\n\n   2. **Results**: [MoonDAO Digital Asset Marketplace](https://vote.moondao.com/#/proposal/0x4301f6d50502fc96f9469b222c135560024cb8dac8e51f70af7d16d4558e1d8e)\n\n   3. **Learnings:** The marketplace project is an excellent example of ideas nurtured and developed from the dev guild. The main topical thread of conversation in the dev guild has been on integration, automation, and abstraction of complexity, eventually leading to the recently approved [app expansion project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d8zFc2t_lhFNKorufd7ZtVo0S-fY5nF_Xe5x0cwTzZo/edit)\n\n   4. **Maintenance**: 0\n\n   5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** .53. **Objective: Maintain current infrastructure**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Regularly monitor status of existing infrastructure (name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get\n\n      2. **Results**: Found several small issues while monitoring websites/bots\n\n      3. **Learnings:** \n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Checked functionality of websites/bots once a week\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.7****\n\n   2. **Key Result**: Create ticket mechanism (name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get\n\n      2. **Results**: Added Ticket Tool to the discord server\n\n      3. **Learnings:** Most members reported bugs in the chat but a few used the ticket bot.\\\n         Following up with members regarding issues is much more streamlined when using Ticket Tool. This will most likely be replaced by Spect.\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Occasionally responded to bug-reports (most of which I created myself)\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.7****\n\n   3. **Key Result**: Review, organize and assign tickets to team (name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get\n\n      2. **Results**: Bug-reports were minimal, I assigned all tickets to myself and fixed the issues.\n\n      3. **Learnings:** Bugs were minimal, it would help to have a system in place to assign tickets to stewards/devs \n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Occasionally reviewed bug-reports and followed up with members having issues in chat.\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.9****\n\n   4. **Key Result**: Insure that code and documentation are up-to-date, define a versioning system for updates and keep track of iterations (name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get\n\n      2. **Results**: Updated documentation for projects as necessary and started using a versioning system to define updates for bots.\n\n      3. **Learnings:** Documentation takes time to write but is very helpful when onboarding new developers.  \n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Occasionally adjusted documentation\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.6****\n\n   5. **Key Result**: Offer technical support to members, contributors and other guilds within MoonDAO (name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get\n\n      2. **Results**: Provided technical support to new members, existing members and stewards.\n\n      3. **Learnings:** Automating tech support for basic questions would be very helpful\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Occasionally messaged members\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.8****\n\n   6. **Key Result**: Review incoming pull requests from contributors in a timely fashion ensuring quality of code is up to standard and bug-free (Larrotiz, name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get, Larrotiz\n\n      2. **Results**: Updates to the dashboard (pushed by Cryptoariel, changes to zeroG page on app). This went relatively smoothly.

Addition of roles should be handled dynamically. We may consider expanding the assessment to cover more niche roles.\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Moving forward this niche aspect of onboarding will be included within the responsibilities of the stewardship proposal.\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** .9****\n\n   3. **Key Result**: Develop a training/on-chain certification system \n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get, Mitchie\n\n      2. **Results**: [Dev guild assessment](https://github.com/Official-MoonDao/Dev-Guild-Assessment), Spect\n\n      3. **Learnings:** This objective is heavily integrated into other processes and so planning and approach took time to develop.\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Maintenance is minimal- Any future requirements for maintenance will be handled within the scope of the stewardship proposal.\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** .5\n\n   4. **Key Result**: Develop a role-oriented matrix for authorized decision-making\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Mitchie\n\n      2. **Results**: None\n\n      3. **Learnings:** This result was predicated on the assumption that guilds would serve as working groups for managing projects, however in practice that approach created confusion.\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: \n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0\n\n5. **Objective: Implementation of protocols for continued improvement**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Define key areas for review and evaluation\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Mitchie\n\n      2. **Results**: None\n\n      3. **Learnings:** This and the next key result were predicated on the assumption that guilds would serve as working groups, however with experience we learned to keep actual work within the scope of projects.\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: None\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0****\n\n   2. **Key Result**: Create open channels for, and document, feedback\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Mitchie\n\n      2. **Results**: None\n\n      3. **Learnings:** \n\n      4. **Maintenance**: \n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:**\n\n   3. **Key Result**: Define a schedule and standard protocols/structure for meetings\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Mitchie\n\n      2. **Results**: None\n\n      3. **Learnings:** Early attempts were made at creating a consistent structure for guild meetings, moreso in response to growth guild meetings than the dev guild, however those attempts failed to take hold. The simple structure of posting a general agenda and covering the most pressing topics has worked well within the dev guild, for which credit goes to Colin.\n\n      4. **Maintenance**: None\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** .6****\n\n   4. **Key Result**: Focus on maintenance and ordered operations (name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get\n\n      2. **Results**: \n\n      3. **Learnings:** \n\n      4. **Maintenance**: \n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:**\n\n   5. **Key Result**: Implementation of improvements and changes (name.get)\n\n      1. **Member(s)**: Name.Get, Cryptoariel\n\n      2. **Results**: Addressed issues submitted on github and discord, also made minor adjustments to styling/formatting for the MoonDAO app and dashboard. \n\n      3. **Learnings:** Having users submit tickets for issues/changes using the Ticket Tool bot in discord makes this process much easier. \n\n      4. **Maintenance**: Occasionally adjusted styling, formatting and addressed minor bugs\n\n      5. **Team’s Self-reported Score:** 0.8\n--------------------------------------------\n\n# **Team Member Contributions**\n\n## _Each member should take some time to fill this out with the specific contributions they had to the team.
