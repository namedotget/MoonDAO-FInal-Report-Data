We sent out 5 weekly emails, [all publicly available here](https://moondao.ck.page/profile), held steady in total subscribers around 12,300, and had about a 40% open rate during that time. Newsletter has shown to be effective in driving clicks to certain initiatives with associated sales bumps in LifeShip kits or MoonDAO decentralized affiliates sales enrollment.\n\n## Results\n\n## 1. **Objective:** Weekly Mooney Monday Emails\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Start up the weekly Mooney Monday emails again with space news, and MoonDAO updates, such as those seen on the [public MoonDAO emails page](https://moondao.ck.page/posts)\n\n      1. **Results**: Sent 5 out of 5 planned weekly emails, also general maintenance such as tagging to reengage cold subscribers, pruning them. Only a few of these emails had an associated Twitter thread or IG link, just because of the lapse in Executive Branch comms role.\n\n      2. **Learnings**: Maintaining steady communication with subscribers is ideal so people know what to expect with our communications and what is going on, and we don‚Äôt allow people to lapse into inactivity (cold subs and unopened emails).\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: Ongoing emails, we also have an annual payment coming due in November. We can export all subscribers easily and move to a different email platform in the future ‚Äì we are not locked into ConvertKit as one is with social media ‚Äì since we ‚Äúown‚Äù our email list. Ryan, Pablo, and Mitchie all have admin access to this account, so there is no risk of ghosting.\n\n      4. **Self-Reported Score**: 0.9- **Sep 25 -** [Exciting Update: MoonDAO's Transition to Guild.xyz](https://moondao.ck.page/posts/exciting-update-moondao-s-transition-to-guild-xyz)\n\n  - 12,375 Recipients ‚Ä¢ 46.9% Open Rate ‚Ä¢ 0.8% Click Rate ‚Ä¢ 554 Clicks ‚Ä¢ 39 Unsubscribers\n\n- **Sep 18 -** [Launching the MoonDAO Marketplace¬†](https://moondao.ck.page/posts/24-hours-left-to-vote)\n\n  - 12,384 Recipients ‚Ä¢ 36.2% Open Rate ‚Ä¢ 1.0% Click Rate ‚Ä¢ 297 Clicks ‚Ä¢ 36 Unsubscribers\n\n- **Sep 11 -** [Unveiling MoonDAO's Master Plan üåï ‚Äì Get a Sneak Peek!¬†](https://moondao.ck.page/posts/unveiling-moondao-s-master-plan-get-a-sneak-peek)\n\n  - 12,396 Recipients ‚Ä¢ 45.8% Open Rate ‚Ä¢ 0.4% Click Rate ‚Ä¢ 261 Clicks ‚Ä¢ 47 Unsubscribers\n\n- **Sep 4 -** [Crew-6 Returns and SpaceX Sets Records¬†](https://moondao.ck.page/posts/crew-6-returns-and-spacex-sets-records)\n\n  - 12,367 Recipients ‚Ä¢ 46.5% Open Rate ‚Ä¢ 0.7% Click Rate ‚Ä¢ 308 Clicks ‚Ä¢ 28 Unsubscribers\n\n- **Aug 28 -** [Back by Popular Demand: Mooney Monday Returns](https://moondao.ck.page/posts/back-by-popular-demand-mooney-monday-returns)\n\n  - 12,409 Recipients ‚Ä¢ 47.1% Open Rate ‚Ä¢ 0.7% Click Rate ‚Ä¢ 441 Clicks ‚Ä¢ 50 Unsubscribers![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXenHoPCWQBtPozxri3ANHj1yycUBxjWNtEeKz_0urHTH3PWEOr47MeqKpWNVDT1psQ1GkiWsSh1yPLJOfoN6AqmYdxXVI-J-MvaAdWAWII5LGNgR6f13PoIkk8wMZSzlb6IBiEwpLNtxY0eRsTfOyYCqVBz?key=NMRYF16TUGAzWZx4Kjxr7A)Engagement metric: \\~67% are five star subscribers, we always clean and maintain to remove the 1 stars and try to move the 2-3 stars up a spot with follow up emails.¬†![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfcxthAhGtMt9sF8vp2TOUMPUpDQkB73zn3Gttgr1BECNKLhh0Nc9SLLfTY85mqCIW32OUMrODcF5o9Kr3RtCkJVHIgm9m1RneqaC8cBZlG0GoR4FKk-yWP6nVBWc3hqyWrlqMMAqT9-w8RNdVPY4K4ipU?key=NMRYF16TUGAzWZx4Kjxr7A)Total Subscribers by Date\n\n## Project Wrap Up Checklist\n\n## - [ ] Added Project Final Report onto the Website Dashboard\n\n- [ ] Upload Final report to the Google Drive\n\n- [ ] Returned excess funds to the Treasury\n\n- [ ] Presented Final Report to Senate\n\n- [ ] Update Discord Roles\n\n- [ ] (if needed) Create documentation for users of the work, or people who will need to maintain the project once it is completed.",
