  "body": "# **MoonDAO Makerspace At Vitalia: Final Report**\n\n\n# **Original Proposal**\n\n**Link to Original Proposal:** \n\n[MDP-123: MoonDAO Makerspace at Vitalia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9sQ8bxWzjFk9X5iBj2H4Ze9wtfIOn1uclHHUvDjTsk/edit#heading=h.piq12i6l9hzn)\\\n**Original Abstract:** \n\n[Vitalia.city](https://vitalia.city) is a [Zuzalu](https://zuzalu.city) inspired pop up city held January 6 to the end of March gathering 200 top entrepreneurs to co-live and co-work. The topics include longevity, crypto cities, and AI. Vitalia is hosted in [Prospera](https://prospera.co/), a special economic zone on the island of Roatan by Honduras freeing tech innovators from burdensome regulation. Though the focus of this inaugural Vitalia is on biotech, Prospera does prioritize innovative aeronautics such as the [Drone Delivery Service HUB](https://www.instagram.com/prosperahn/p/Cz_9RSLP8rY). This proposal is to support a makerspace/hackerspace in Prospera during Vitalia in partnership with MoonDAO.\n\n\n# **Results**\n\nWe were able to hit all critical milestones in order to bring the Makerspace to an operational level in a short amount of time. We conducted 25 events with over 300+ different people including big names like Balajis Srivansan, Bryan Johnson, and Naval Ravikant getting exposure and access to the makerspace. We created a Wiki to inform the community about our efforts and will expand our operations and messaging around the project in Q2. We encountered shipping delays and procurement challenges operating in this LATAM location, and our location isn’t ideal for coworking applications however these limiting factors can and will be easily overcome soon.  \n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n1. **Objective: Establish a working makerspace at Vitalia**\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Establish a working makerspace at Vitalia (initially, shared space with the Vitalia Biohacking Lab is confirmed)\n\n      1. **Results**: 3 Exceeds Expectations because far more Vitalians utilize the space than we anticipated. We brought the [makerspace experience](https://app.charmverse.io/makerspace/makerspace-experience-8041654149445827) to life. We hosted 25 unique events during the short period of time the space was operational. \n\n      2. **Learnings**:The lab and makerspace became the heart of the community at Vitalia where creators could both socialize and interact with the technology and ideaspace. The procurement process presented challenges but the builders improvised and fun times were had by all. \n\n      3. **Maintenance**: The wiki presents a simple management interface and system by which we can inform and grow the community and knowledge base in a clear format. \n\n2) **Key Result**: Wiki for maker resources throughout Roatan and the mainland\n\n   1. **Results**: 2 Meets Expectations because it’s still early days. [our living wiki](https://app.charmverse.io/makerspace/makerspace-wiki-19377272787222233)  \n\n   2. **Learnings**: Creating the ideal balance between a simplistic public facing wiki and a full role management web3 backend using charmverse was challenging.  \n\n   3. **Maintenance**: Frazier and Jason have agreed to maintain the wiki and will update it as necessary for best practices [inventory control](https://app.charmverse.io/makerspace/inventory-management-system-2212864590380761), [event recaps](https://app.charmverse.io/makerspace/biomedical-engineering-training-program-9523857372020377), and ongoing project updates.  ****\n\n3) **Key Result**: Buy equipment, and governance/signaling system for purchasing decisions\n\n   1. **Results**: 2 Meets Expectations because it’s hard getting equipment to Roatan but our internal coordination is going great. List of [equipment purchased](https://app.charmverse.io/makerspace/tools-9071485567686279). <https://snapshot.org/#/makerspace.eth> \n\n   2. **Learnings**: Additional funds were requested to account for extraordinary shipping costs related to procurement of resources to reach the island.  \n\n   3. **Maintenance**: This will be the permanent system going forward to provide maximum transparency. ****\n\n4) **Key Result**: Recruit makerspace manager during Vitalia\n\n   1. **Results**: 4 Superb having some of the world’s leading cyberneticists run the Makerspace is fortuitous. SymbiontLabs.io ([Frazier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frazier-farrell/), Cassox, and Jason) has agreed to host the equipment and maintain the space for this time period and Q2.       \n\n   2. **Learnings**: Gatherings and [workshops](https://app.charmverse.io/makerspace/cassox-projects-9051514378713887) of up to 20-30 participants required two hosts to manage effectively. A dedicated makerspace(only) manager may not be required in the near term.  \n\n   3. **Maintenance**:  A formal maintenance plan will be developed during this time as capacity and consumption assumptions are tested.      ****\n\n5) **Key Result**: Determine a funding flywheel (likely, annual membership)\n\n   1. **Results**: 2 Meets Expectations because we haven’t gotten close to the makerspace flywheel, as we still need to be established enough to justify charging membership, but our benefactors Symbiont and [Ixian.tech](https://ixian.tech) have established substantial funding and flywheels which should help support our space’s continued operations. This is a work in progress. Due to logistical delays in receiving and installation of equipment on the island we are still too early to support a working member workshop model and we pivoted to focus on regular events to spark donations.  \n\n   2. **Learnings**: The impermanent nature of the operating space makes short term sponsorships not viable. This will change as the space moves into a new facility in Q2 and the local community can be activated.    \n\n   3. **Maintenance**: The ongoing costs for the makerspace upkeep can only be estimated in its current state, at $200 per month. As more equipment is procured and utilized, consumption can be monitored and costs can be accurately mapped to member models and events as a goal for Q2. The current cost estimates assume a monthly member workshop event with between 10-30 participants and random machine utilization of between 5-10 hours per week.  [Budget Link](https://app.charmverse.io/makerspace/finance-5120802121213914)&#x20;\n\n**Grade:** _How well did you do on the original objective?_\n\n**_4 Superb_** _= This is reserved for if the project went incredibly well without any flaws and vastly surpassed all original metrics. Very few projects will meet this grade._\n\n**_3 Exceeds Expectations_** _= Did better than expected. The team surpassed expectations and went above and beyond the original scope of the project._\n\n**_2 Meets Expectations_** _= The project met all its original goals and sufficiently hit all the criteria._\n\n**_1 Does not meet Expectations_** _= The project did not achieve its original goal._\n\n\n# **Member Contributions**\n\n**@bestape:** Was Vitalia's official Makerspace Champion.

Used the 3d printers and instructed others in their use. Created snapshot proposals to decide fund allocations and track project progress. Maintained the labspace that housed the equipment. Assisted in constructing an indoor greenhouse tent to store the resin 3d printer to vent noxious fumes during use. Spoke during presentations for the makerspace to inform the Vitalia community of the lab’s activities. Contributed to the Makerspace Wiki where logs of our activities and inventory is kept.   \n\n**@cassox:** I coordinated with Frazier, purchased the silicone molding equipment, and participated in classes pertaining to use of the printers and 3d scanner. I reached out and found 2 new collaborators who work in the prosthetics industry who are interested in contributing to our project. Currently working on an analysis of prosthetic design in anticipation of creating the CADs once we have our patient scans.\n\n**@jason\\_n\\_state\\_fan:**  [**Coordinape Comments**](https://app.coordinape.com/profile/0x9345a54906191505c6efd5fdd6a3f02d994c44aa)Working with Frazier to build a sustainable management system for the Makerspace, engage key stakeholders on the island, and organize ongoing educational programs to help spread the message and expand the scope of the program. \n\n**@ryand2d:** High level coordination with the team about the project, updates to the DAO, helping the team understand MoonDAO processes and procedures, supplying them with info or graphics, etc, as needed.\n\n\n# **Reward Distribution**\n\n[Link to the Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/circles/30464/map?epochId=0)\n\n|                       |                        |                     |                                            |                                            |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| **Member Name**       | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** | **Wallet to receive ETH**                  | **Wallet to receive MOONEY**               |\n| @ryand2d              | 10.83333333            | NONE                | 0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99 | 0x78176eaabcb3255e898079dc67428e15149cdc99 |\n| @bestape              | 29.66666667            | NONE                | 0x0D89421D6eec0A4385F95f410732186A2Ab45077 | 0x0D89421D6eec0A4385F95f410732186A2Ab45077 |\n| @fraiz.\\_.            | 22.16666667            | NONE                | 0xa1d84cd4ab2e106b8114842b6b902e9462a73bad | 0xa1d84cd4ab2e106b8114842b6b902e9462a73bad |\n| @cassox               | 16.83333333            | NONE                | 0x3D3c0B40daaED87D75FeB611BB5ac66Ebaa2E4Ae | 0x3D3c0B40daaED87D75FeB611BB5ac66Ebaa2E4Ae |\n| @jason\\_n\\_state\\_fan | 11.5                   | NONE                | 0x9345a54906191505c6Efd5FDd6A3F02D994C44Aa | 0x9345a54906191505c6Efd5FDd6A3F02D994C44Aa |\n| @pmoncada             | 7.666666667            | NONE                | 0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6 | 0x679d87D8640e66778c3419D164998E720D7495f6 |\n| @haonchon             | 0.8333333333           | NONE                | 0x850a146D7478dAAa98Fc26Fd85e6A24e50846A9d | 0x850a146D7478dAAa98Fc26Fd85e6A24e50846A9d |\n| Coordinape            | 0.5                    | NONE                | 0x15B513F658f7390D8720dCE321f50974B28672EF | 0x15B513F658f7390D8720dCE321f50974B28672EF |\n\n\n# **Treasury Transparency**\n\n[Link to the Treasury__](https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=eth:0xB81160c24D6482C87BC9640313031cf844429664)_NOTE: As a MoonDAO grant to build this Makerspace and support operations, funds will not be returned to the MoonDAO treasury._\n\n|                     |                               |            |               |                                                                                               |                                                    |\n| ------------------: | ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n|       **Txn Title** | **Reason**                    | **Amount** | **Recipient** | **Etherscan Link or Gnosis Link**                                                             | **Deliverable**                                    |\n|             Nonce 1 |                               | 3,350.72   |               | <https://etherscan.com/tx/0xc5a5e46064355fe3053071f1e4cbf8a5d484ba8af59d514541963ecf1c192bd0> | Reimbursement for purchase of makerspace equipment |\n|             Nonce 0 | Owner Swap, Noah for Frazier. |            |               | <https://etherscan.com/tx/0x13306fd0eea2de18ab864852766c675c9133a171f009c805e24538e2c62a421c> |                                                    |\n| Funding Transaction |                               | 5,000 DAI  |               | <https://etherscan.com/tx/0x4a9a34fab2e0de7dfa9f2b0b4bf91547a52a26274b9a70ec31a5afcfd5d6dc5b> | Funds from MoonDAO                                 |\n|       Safe Creation |                               |            |               | <https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc85bee83605b57b0426e10a712ec34397dfbdd96d1b64c06500d3f6cb26c60bf>  | Safe creation                                      |",
