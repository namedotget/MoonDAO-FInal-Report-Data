The process was much more difficult than we anticipated, we had to sign over 1500 transactions during this project, some of them with 3 signers. \n\n## Results\n\n1. **Objective:** MoonDAO Members receive vMOONEY directly for their Contributions, rather than MOONEY\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Successfully send Q1 and Q2 payments sent out in vMOONEY manually\n\n      1. **Results**: Everyone received their vMooney, you can check the multi-sig of each contributor [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aUOAOmXIHJmg5pTUbWFITIwX30gr7STlSwycn9SQSrM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n      2. **Learnings**: The process is a little complex, and time-consuming, especially because the current UI for multi-sigs has bugs from time to time. 80% of the time spent was debugging and finding ways to make the flow work.\n\n      3. **Maintenance**: An unlock button is needed on the next version of our app, each contributor is the only owner of each multi-sig, so maybe some additional guidance is needed when the time come, or if they want to change the delegated address.\n\n      4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 1\n\n      5. **Team Contributions\\\n         Colin**: Added the Safe connection to the [app](https://main--moondao-app-expansion-test.netlify.app/lock), debugged initial transactions, created multi-sigs for each contributor.**Lucas**: Built and adjusted the transaction flow, Debugged the nested wallets connection, debugged stuck transactions, submitted transactions on each multi-sig, signed transactions.**Pablo**: Signed transactions, gameplanned with the team. Made sure things were moving along. Helped with some initial set up.**Ryan:** Stepped in for Colin in signing transactions once Colin jumped off the team.****2. **Key Result**: Payments going forward are sent out in vMOONEY with a new implementation\n\n   1. **Results**: The system we have is reproducible, but time intensive and complex. \n\n   2. **Learnings**: We can improve some aspects of the system by having a “trusted” contributor rather than a multisig throughout the process, however there are centralization risks around the approach.\n\n   3. **Maintenance**: A report should be created for individuals to claim their vMOONEY at the end of the period. Within the app we need to add the “unlock” in the UI to allow people to remove their stake within the next four years. We will add this in the next app feature.\n\n   4. **Team’s Self-Reported Score**: 0.5\n\n   5. **Team Contributions\\\n      Colin**: Prepare the transaction flow.**Lucas**: Prepare the transaction flow.**Pablo**: Prepare the transaction flow.****\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Coordinape Results\n\n## [Link to the Coordinape](https://app.coordinape.com/circles/17920/give): Make the Astronauts the admin.|                 |                        |                     |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Member Name** | **% of total rewards** | **Upfront Payment** |\n| **Colin**       | 15                     | 0                   |\n| **Lucas**       | 65                     | 0                   |\n| **Pablo**       | 15                     | 0                   |\n| **Ryan**        | 5                      | 0                   |\n\n## Treasury Transparency\n\n## Link to [Treasury](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xea51cc4b6bDF5E3066f5B6F04CDa66Fea0a8877C) with unused funds returned to the main DAO Treasury.|               |            |            |               |                                   |                 |\n| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |\n| **Txn Title** | **Reason** | **Amount** | **Recipient** | **Etherscan Link or Gnosis Link** | **Deliverable** |\n|               |            |            |               |                                   |                 |\n|               |            |            |               |                                   |                 |\n\n## [L2 operations wallet transparency](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=matic:0x9848400152e3bbA12f3b9Da8F24C22a8E0026eD8)",
