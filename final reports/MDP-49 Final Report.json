The products include many bugs and change quickly. We should keep an eye on this and shouldn’t spend too much effort on a single platform. \n\n      5. **Maintenance**: The new transaction will be displayed automatically, however, it needs someone to label the transactions and add new project wallets. This task should be done monthly or quarterly. 2) **Objective #2**: Keep MoonDAO treasury transparent\n\n   1. **Key Result**: Labeled & reviewed all translation data over the past year [Transaction data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wYxxI_-lAn3Rr5uDZcvtg6yCQ-XS3lwt/edit#gid=45692109) .
